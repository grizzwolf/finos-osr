   Object code incorporating header file material from the library that is not limited to numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors or small macros, inline functions and templates of fewer than ten lines must include a prominent notice that the library is used, its use is covered by LGPL-3.0, and provide a copy of the license (see section 3 for more details)

This must include installation information as defined in GPL-3.0, if necessary to install and execute a modified version of the combined work (see sections 4d and 4e for more details).
