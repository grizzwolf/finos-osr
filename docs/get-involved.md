OPEN SOURCE LICENSE COMPLIANCE HANDBOOK

This handbook provides information on how to comply with some of the more common open source licenses under a specific set of use-cases. The goal here is to provide developers and engineers with some "self-serve" information to facilitate the end goal of open source license compliance, as well as identifying some of the more complex open source license compliance aspects for which consultation with open source counsel may be recommended.
