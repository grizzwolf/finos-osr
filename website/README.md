# Adding Content

## Adding a new docs page to an existing sidebar

1. Create the doc as a new markdown file in `/docs`, example `docs/newly-created-doc.md`:

```md
---
id: newly-created-doc
title: This Doc Needs To Be Edited
---

My new content here..
```

1. Refer to that doc's ID in an existing sidebar in `website/sidebar.json`:

```javascript
// Add newly-created-doc to the Getting Started category of docs
{
  "docs": {
    "Getting Started": [
      "quick-start",
      "newly-created-doc" // new doc here
    ],
    ...
  },
  ...
}
```

## Adding a new blog post

1. Make sure there is a header link to your blog in `website/siteConfig.js`:

`website/siteConfig.js`
```javascript
headerLinks: [
    ...
    { blog: true, label: 'Blog' },
    ...
]
```

2. Create the blog post with the format `YYYY-MM-DD-My-Blog-Post-Title.md` in `website/blog`:

`website/blog/2018-05-21-New-Blog-Post.md`

```markdown
---
author: Frank Li
authorURL: https://twitter.com/foobarbaz
authorFBID: 503283835
title: New Blog Post
---

Lorem Ipsum...
```

## Adding items to your site's top navigation bar

1. Add links to docs, custom pages or external links by editing the headerLinks field of `website/siteConfig.js`:

`website/siteConfig.js`
```javascript
{
  headerLinks: [
    ...
    /* you can add docs */
    { doc: 'my-examples', label: 'Examples' },
    /* you can add custom pages */
    { page: 'help', label: 'Help' },
    /* you can add external links */
    { href: 'https://github.com/facebook/Docusaurus', label: 'GitHub' },
    ...
  ],
  ...
}
```

For more information about the navigation bar, click [here](https://docusaurus.io/docs/en/navigation)

## Adding custom pages

1. Docusaurus uses React components to build pages. The components are saved as .js files in `website/pages/en`:
1. If you want your page to show up in your navigation header, you will need to update `website/siteConfig.js` to add to the `headerLinks` element:

`website/siteConfig.js`
```javascript
{
  headerLinks: [
    ...
    { page: 'my-new-custom-page', label: 'My New Custom Page' },
    ...
  ],
  ...
}
```

## Custom CSS & Design Changes

1. Changing logos for the Header and Footer and Favicon are done in website/siteConfig.js file in the /* path to images for header/footer */ section

Note: make sure that you add your new logos to the website/static/img folder first.

2. Change the main logo in the "SplashContainer" area of website/index.js file.

Note: make sure that you add your new logos to the website/static/img folder first.

3. Change the background color and the background transparent image in the website/static/css/custom.css file.

Go to the section labeled: .homeContainer 

Change "background-image" - and insert your new background image file. Note - make sure you add your new background transparent image file to the website/static/img folder first.

Change "background-color" to your Project's main color (FDC3 is #0033A0)

4. Change the .svg icons in the "gridBlock" (examples on FDC3 - the 4 .svg icons for API / Intents / Context Data / App Director) - you have to open the actual .svg files in the website/static/img folder with a program like Adobe Illustrator. Change the color of the entire file to your Project's main color (FDC3 is #0033A0) - and then save the file. The icon will change color. (NOote - If there is a way to change the .svg's using CSS, have not been able to do so yet. It should be possible.)

5. Change the section header titles (example for FDC3: Use Cases & Who is Usind FDC3) by changing the website/static/css/custom.css file. Change the h2 tags for .featureShowcaseSection h2 and .productShowcaseSection h2 to your Project's color (FDC3 is #0033A0).

6. Interior Introduction Page - Change logo by on this page (example for FDC3: docs/fdc3-intro.md) by changing the "(assets/fdc3-logo.png)" to the new logo name.

Note: make sure that you add your new logo to the docs/assets folder first - this is a separate image repository from the "website" part.
